# judgement-bingo
Quick simple web app I am putting together for a family holiday. It bingo cards where the dumb stuff we do are squares. The interesting part of it is that the prompts are encrypted and shared with everyone except the subject of the prompt. So not even I, the owner of the app, can see what my siblings have put for my behaviour.
